# participles

- the present active participle takes -i in ablative when used as an 
  adjective, but -e when used substantively or when it takes a direct object. 
  - a patre amanti
  - cum patre filium amante
  - ab amante amatur

## passive periphrastic

- with intransitives it's impersonal and neuter. 
- with transitives the subject's gender and case must be matched.

# gender quirks

- res rei (f)
- gens gentis (f)
- we use multi/multos to refer to many people, multa/multa to refer to many things

# subjunctive notes
- Bare subjunctives can function as the main clause (apodosis) of a past contrary-to-fact condition. 
- This type of clause expresses what would have happened in the past if circumstances had been different.
- To express "he would have drunk," you need to use the pluperfect subjunctive.

>    The verb form is: bibisset.

- When you use this "bare" subjunctive, the "if" clause is implied from the context. 
- So, et bibisset would stand on its own and mean "...and he would have drunk (if the water hadn't receded)."
- Imperfect Subjunctive (biberet): Used for a present contrary-to-fact condition. 
  - It means "he would be drinking" (right now, if things were different).
- Pluperfect Subjunctive (bibisset): Used for a past contrary-to-fact condition. 
  - It means "he would have drunk" (at that moment in the past, if things had been different).


# Clauses introduced by Dum, Dōnec, Quoad


## Dum, dōnec, and quoad, as long as, take the Indicative 

Indicative present is used of an attempted action ('Conative Present'); as

>    dum vītant vitia, in contrāria currunt. 

Examples involving historical present + dum: 

> Alexander, dum inter prīmōrēs pugnat, sagittā ictus est, 

Alexander, while he was fighting in the van, was struck by an arrow;

> dum haec geruntur, in fīnēs Venellōrum pervēnit, 

while these things were being done, he arrived in the territory of the Venelli.

> dum anima est, spēs est, 

and

> Lacedaemoniōrum gēns fortis fuit, dum Lycūrgī lēgēs vigēbant, 

the race of the Lacedaemonians was powerful, as long as the laws of Lycurgus were in force;

> Catō, quoad vīxit, virtūtum laude crēvit, 

Cato, at long as he lived, increased in the fame of his virtues.

## Dum, dōnec, and quoad, until, take

### The Indicative, to denote an actual event

>    dōnec rediit, fuit silentium, 

there was silence till he came;

>   ferrum in corpore retinuit, quoad renūntiātum est Boeōtiōs vīcisse, 

he kept the iron in his body until word was brought that the Boeotians had conquered.

#### In Livy and subsequent historians dum and dōnec in this sense often take the Subjunctive instead of the Indicative

>    trepidātiōnis aliquantum ēdēbant dōnec timor quiētem fēcisset, 

they showed some trepidation, until fear produced quiet.

### The Subjunctive, to denote anticipation or expectancy

>    exspectāvit Caesar dum nāvēs convenīrent, 

Caesar waited for the ships to assemble;

>    dum litterae veniant, morābor, 

I shall wait for the letter to come.

# similis with genitive versus with dative

## The Rule: `Similis` with Dative or Genitive

The adjective `similis` ("like, similar") can be followed by a noun in either the dative or the genitive case. While they are often used interchangeably, there is a distinct tendency in classical prose:

1.  **The Genitive Case** is typically preferred when `similis` refers to **living beings**, especially personal pronouns (`mei`, `tui`, `sui`, `nostri`, `vestri`) and other persons. It often implies an essential or internal likeness (in character, nature, etc.).

2.  **The Dative Case** is used more broadly for both **persons and things**. It can denote a more external or general similarity and is the more common construction overall, especially for inanimate objects.

## Sources and Examples

This distinction is explained in standard reference grammars. For instance, **Allen and Greenough's New Latin Grammar, §359.b** notes:

> "Adjectives signifying likeness, fitness, friendliness, and their opposites, take the Dative... *Similis* (like) sometimes takes the Genitive, but this is an early use, and is common in Cicero only in the phrase *veri similis* (probable), and of persons, especially the personal pronouns..."

**Examples from Classical Authors:**

* **With Genitive (Persons):**
    * `Filius est **similis patris**.` (The son is like his father.)
    * `Nemo est **similis tui**.` (No one is like you.)

* **With Dative (Things):**
    * `Mors est **somno similis**.` (Death is like sleep.)
    * `Haec vox est **illi voci similis**.` (This voice is similar to that voice.)
