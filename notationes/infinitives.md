# Infinitives

## Basics

- Each verb has *six* infinitives
  - Three active (present, perfect, future)
  - Three passive (present, perfect, future)

- Example: Laudare
  - laudare 
  - laudavisse
  - laudaturum, a, um esse
  - laudari 
  - laudatum, a, um esse
  - laudatum iri

- Note that future active and perfect passive use verbal adjectives (=participles)!
- Past active infinitive is built from the past stem + isse.
- The perfect and future infinitives are rarely to be translated / understood literally.
