ei qui se agriculturae dedicat intellegendum est se debere arcessere posse materias sibi adiuventes has: scientiam rei, copiam ad sumptui sustinendum, et voluntatem operam dandi. nam denique, ut ait tremelius, is optime aratam terram possidebit qui tenet scientiam, copias, et voluntatem eam colere. scientia atque voluntas non sufficient cuiquam sine copiis a pensis requisitis. voluntas autem vel copiae ad sumptus committendos nihil efficiet sine scientia artis, cum res praestans ullius negotii sit intellegere id quod agendum est, et praecipue in agricultura, ubi voluntas et copiae, sine scientia, saepe ruinam infert possidentibus cum sumptus commissi perditi sunt negotio ex ignorantia facto.

nequeo discernere. haec eadem veritas nuda est apertaque lux diei, quae praebet personas, histriones, victorias mundi non dimidie tam eleganter belluleque quam lux candelae. veritas fortasse pretium margaritae attinet, quae die optime lucet, sed non adipisci alta adamantis possit, vel gemmae, quae se ostendunt optime luce mutante. mendacio paulo admixto, voluptas semper augetur. Dubitatne aliquis, an si raperentur ex hominibus opiniones vana, spes blandae, estimationes falsae, imaginationes rerum cupitarum, et similia, id quod relinquerentur in mentibus plurum hominum exsanguie et desiccatum esset, completum tristitia et absurditate, sibi odiosum? unus pater severissime poesem "vinum daemonum" nominat quia imaginatio complet, tamen umbra mendacii. sed volans per mente mendacium non nocet, sed haerens et sedens, ut ante dictum est. at quomodocumque hae res in iudiciis affectibusque pravis hominum sunt, tamen veritas, tantum de se iudicans, exquisitionem veritatis, id est eam complectare et procare, scientiam veritatis, id est eam in promptu habere, et assensionem veritatis, id est ea frui, esse summum bonum humanitatis docet.

sicut parvuli timent tenebras inire homines mortem timent, et veluti primus timor fabulis augetur, ita secundus. certe, contemplatio mortis, ut merces peccati, et transitio in alio mundo, sacra religiosaque est; sed timor eiusdem, ut testamentum naturae, ignavus est. tamen in meditationibus religiosis nonnumquam confusio vanitatis et superstitionis est. legeris in aliquibus libris sacerdotum de mortificatione, hominem debet consilium sibi capere, quid esset dolor, si tantum cuspis digiti sui comprimeretur vel cruciaretur, et inde imaginare quid dolor mortis est, cum totum corpus corruitur et dissolvitur, nam saepe mortus transitus est minus cum dolore quam ubi artus excruciatur, quoniam vitalia non sunt alacerrima sensu. et ab eo qui modo ut philosophus et homo naturalis dixit, bene dicitur, "Pompa mortis magis terret, quam mors ipsa." gemitús et convulsiones, facies male colorata, amici flentes, et atra et exequiae, et similia, mortum terribilem esse demonstrant. est dignum notatu, nullum affectum in mente hominis tam fessum esse ne timorem per eo superetur, et igitur mors non est tam inimicus terribilis, cum homo tot adiutores in promptu habet qui id expugnare possint. ultio mortem vincit; amor id abicit; honor id studet; maeror ad id volat; timor id preoccupat; immo, ut legimus, postquam otho imperator sua manu interfectus est, misericordia, tenerrimus affectus, multas ad se interficiendas ex mera miseratione regi incitavit, verissima secutores.

immo, seneca addit elegantiam et satietatem: reputes quam saepe te eadem res repetiturum esse; non solum fortes et miseri sunt qui mori velle, sed quoque ii defessi. quidam mori velit, qui tamen non sit robustus neque miser, sed ex taedio iterum iterumque eiusdem rei agendi. non minus dignum est notatu, quam paulum mors accedens bonum animum mutat: tales homines eandem speciem praebent donec ultimum tempus. caesar augustus expiravit blandiens: livia, foedus nuptiarum nostrarum in mente, vive, et vale. tiberius in dissimulatione, ut ait tacitus: "nam, ea quae deficiebant tiberio erant corpus suum et vires, non acumen." vespasian inter iocus, in sella sedens, ait, "videor deus factus esse." galba cum sententiá, "ice, si ita velint populi romani" collum suum extendens; septimus severus in epistula, "este, si quidnam remaneat ad mihi agendum," et cetera. nimirum, stoici pretium maiorem morti attribuerunt, et magnopere parando speciem eius terribiliorem fecerunt. melius dixit qui "ultimam finem vitae cum muneribus naturae posuit." morimur aeque naturaliter quam nascimur; infanti parvulo, unum aeque dolet ac alterum. is qui insequens sincere moritur sicut est unum qui vulneratur in sanguine callido et qui, paulo tempore, non vulnus sentit. ergo mens in aliquid bonum defixa et eo nitens, avertit dolores mortis; sed supra omnes, crede, cantus dulcissimus est, "nunc, demittis," cum homo destinata digna et expectationes adeptus sit. praeterea mors quoque facit ut portam ad famam bonam aperiatur, et invidiam extinguit: "hic idem, mortuus, amabitur."

cum coniuratio catilinae deprehensa erat, et ceteri senatores poena extrema illis implicatis insidiis exerceri voluerant, caesar, qui tum praetor electus est, solus proposuit ut sua confiscarentur et ii in oppidis singulis in carceribus compescerentur. immo, amplius, talem metum in malentes modos severiores instigavit, pingens quam odirentur a populo romano in perpetuum, ut decimo silano, consuli electo, non pudet propositionem suam molliri (quia mutari abiectius fuisset), dicens eam acceptam fuisse multo acriorem quam destinavit. caesar vincisset quoque, quoniam multi ad eum transmissi erant, cicerone adnumerato, fratre consulis, nisi oratio marci catonis senatum dubitantem confirmasset.

intra bellum punici secundum, cum hannibal, dux carthaginiensum, potentiam italiae ictum dederat gravissimum postquam statura nationis romanae alta et magna attacta erat, masinissa, rex numidiae, socius publii scipionis (posthac nominatur africanum propter victorias suas) factus est, et plura acta illustria armorum confecit. ad hoc referendum, carthagine devincta, syphace cuius imperio africae magna lataque fuit capto, populi romani masinissae omnia urbes et territoria ab eo bellando capessita munum dedit. itaque masinissa semper amicus verus et fidelis nobis fuit.

primum et caput munerum meorum est, ut puto, negotium quod incepi cognoscere plane, aditus quem secutus sum omni in divisione curriculi mei. crederem neminem officium suum perficere posse firmius, neque ullum alterum modum decernendi inter tentanda vitandaque. nec credo ullam maiorem esse infamiam quam munera assignata sua secundum consilium adiutorum suorum consequi. hoc necessario accidet quandocunque dux consuetudine eget et confugit ad subditos suos; hi minores muneribus essentialibus funguntur, scilicet, sed tantum ut adiutantes, instrumenta, dicamus, in manibus ducis.

m. valerio maximo et p. decio mure consulibus, triginta annos post initio belli contra pentros, aqua appia collata est in urbem ab appio claudio censore (seriusque caecum nuncupatus). illo anno, idem homo praefectus est viae appiae construendae ab porta capena usque ad capuam. collega appii in censurá fuit gaius plautius, venox vocatus quia venas huius aquae comperit. sed plautius ab censurá abdicavit priusquam octodecim mensium spatium confectum est, deceptus ab appio dissimulante ut idem faceret; itaque aqueductus nominatum secundum appium solum est. immo, appius fertur tempus censurae suae porrigere multis coniurationibus, donec viam aqueductumque perficere potuisset.

ita, consilio et virtute mulierum urbs liberata est. decretum est ut 
omnes feminae in proelio casae obruendae essent in via argia. superantibus
concessio data est ad signum marti instituendum, ut virtus earum memoranda esset. 

de die proelii, alii ferunt pugnatum fuisse sexdecima die, alii kalendas illius mensis numerati quarti apud argivos (sed qui quondam ultimus ab eis conputatus est). hoc die ritus quidam adhuc celebrati sunt apud argivos in quibus mulieres sunt sagis et vestimentis hominum amictae dum homines ferulas portant et caeremoniis participant cum capitibus velatis. itaque, ut restituerentur amissio civium occisarum, ut ait herodotus, posthac elegerunt ex rusticis circum urbem habitantibus, nam unusquisque melius ceteris visus est, civitates eos receperunt, sibi matrimonio iunxerunt.

hi, dein, publi mi, sunt viri qui ad consultationem tibi vocandi sunt antequam ullum foederem agriculturae iceris, et sine ulla perfectionis exspectatione attingi totae rei dictis eorum, nam commentaria talium scriptorum artificem docent, non efficiunt. exercitatio enim atque consuetudo regnant in fabricis, et semper docentur omnes sua errata. nam cum periculum male gestum perditur, vitanda sunt errata comissa consiliisque doctoris recta via lucetur. itaque praecepta nostra non tendunt perducere scientiam usque ad perfectionem, sed profert manum.

salutationes abundantes, et multa bona noctes, numerosiora quam stellae in caelo et pisces in mare. bene sciendum est tibi quam valeo, et mater mea. gratum esset item de te audiverem, nam cotidie cogito de te saltem semel. te sinante, audito unum miraculum ab aliquo procero factum: satanus eum perpetue confundat! nam offensionem dedit magistro nostro petro meyero ad cenam apud multos nobiles dominosque, et non praebebat non unam stillam pudoris, sed tam arrogans erat ut attonitus essem.
