# Infinitives

## Basics

- Each verb has *six* infinitives
  - Three active (present, perfect, future)
  - Three passive (present, perfect, future)

- Example: Laudare
  - laudare 
  - laudavisse
  - laudaturus, a, um esse
  - laudari 
  - laudatus, a, um esse
  - laudatum iri

- Note that future active and perfect passive use verbal adjectives (=participles)!
- Past active infinitive is built from the past stem + isse.
- The perfect and future infinitives are rarely to be translated / understood literally.

## Usage Summary

- Neuter verbal noun (*errare est humanum*).
- Verb complement (*debeo ire*).
- Direct object clause anchor (*iussit eos venire*).
- Indirect statement / speech report.

## Infinitives in Indirect Statements

- Latin allows for both direct speech reports and indirect speech reports.
  - Direct (with the special verb "inquit"): *Iulia, magister inquit, discipula est bona*.
    - "Julia," says the teacher, "is a good student."
  - Indirect: *Magister dicit Iuliam esse bonam discipulam*.
    - The teacher says that Julia is a good student.

- Latin indirect statement contrasts with English in two major ways:
  1. Latin doesn't use subordinate clauses, but rather infinitive phrases with accusative subjects.
  2. Latin doesn't use a complementizer word like "that" in English.
