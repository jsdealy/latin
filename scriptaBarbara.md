ei qui se agriculturae dedicat intellegendum est se debere arcessere posse materias sibi adiuventes has: scientiam rei, copiam ad sumptui sustinendum, et voluntatem operam dandi. nam denique, ut ait tremelius, is optime aratam terram possidebit qui tenet scientiam, copias, et voluntatem eam colere. scientia atque voluntas non sufficient cuiquam sine copiis a pensis requisitis. voluntas autem vel copiae ad sumptus committendos nihil efficiet sine scientia artis, cum res praestans ullius negotii sit intellegere id quod agendum est, et praecipue in agricultura, ubi voluntas et copiae, sine scientia, saepe ruinam infert possidentibus cum sumptus commissi perditi sunt negotio ex ignorantia facto.

admirato agros magnos, attamen parvum arato. 

hac praecepta, a doctissimo quodam versui impressa, ut opinor, 
hereditas antiquitatis est, ita constat apud carthaginienses, populos
acutissimos, dictum fuisse hoc: subigatur ager viro. 
nam cum ei luctandum sit, si vincitur a terra, obruitur dominus. 
et haud dubie est ager latus perperam cultus minus confert quam parvus
accuratissime aratus.

sed si amnis collibus procul abest, et si regionis salus et ripae paulo elevatae villa super aquas fluitantes posita esse permittuntur, cures etiam ut amnis post non ante villam sit et frons aedis avertatur a ventis nocentibus illi regioni propriis et in amicissimis. nam pleri amnes asperginibus fumant, calidae in aestate frigidaeque hieme, et nisi disperguntur viribus praestantibus ventús contra fluentium, hominem bestiamque perdunt.

ut incipimus, scientia multarum rerum tendena est, sine qua oratio modo vanitas vel gurges vaniloquentiae ridicula est. modus proprius fingendus est non tantum verbis eligendis, sed eisdem ordinandis. et omnes affectus mentis dati a natura hominibus intime intellegendi sunt, quia vires oratorii completae scientiaeque in affectibus tranquillandis vel incendendis audientium adhibendae sunt. Ad hoc addenda sint quaedam iucunditas, aliquae fulminae sagacitatis, cultus aptus domino, et facultas et brevitas repellendi et impetus faciendi, cuncto quodam lepore contexto. porro, historia praeteriti totius et thesaurum praeiudicii memoria tenenda sunt, nec fere licet scientiam legis statuarii vel legis nationis omitti.

et quorsum describere modum dicendi oratoris pergam? gubernandum est hoc corpore gerendo, motibus brachiorum, lusitando subtilitatem, vocem versando in pronuntione---et quantum pendat de illo ipso ars actoris levis et theatrum proclamant, nam illic, cum omnes laborent ut ordinent verba, vocem, et motum corporis, quam paucos actores esse, vel umquam fuisse, quos spectare pati possimus sciunt omnes!

omnis interpretatio scripturae duabus rebus pendet: discendo id quod discendum est, et praebendo discitum. disseram de discendo primum, deinde de praebendo. magna moles et ardua haec, difficile sustineri, et ut timeo, imprudens moliri.
