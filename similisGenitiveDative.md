# Similis: Genitive Versus Dative

## The Rule: `Similis` with Dative or Genitive

The adjective `similis` ("like, similar") can be followed by a noun in either the dative or the genitive case. 

The genitive is used for personal pronouns ("similar to you") and other terms referring to people
(similar to his father). The dative is used more broadly.


## Examples

* **With Genitive (Persons):**
    * `Filius est similis patris.` (The son is like his father.)
    * `Nemo est similis tui.` (No one is like you.)

* **With Dative (Things):**
    * `Mors est somno similis.` (Death is like sleep.)
    * `Haec vox est illi voci similis.` (This voice is similar to that voice.)
