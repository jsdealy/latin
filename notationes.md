# participles

- the present active participle takes -i in ablative when used as an 
  adjective, but -e when used substantively or when it takes a direct object. 
  - a patre amanti
  - cum patre filium amante
  - ab amante amatur

## passive periphrastic

- with intransitives it's impersonal and neuter. 
- with transitives the subject's gender and case must be matched.

# gender quirks

- res rei (f)
- gens gentis (f)
- we use multi/multos to refer to many people, multa/multa to refer to many things

# subjunctive notes
- Bare subjunctives can function as the main clause (apodosis) of a past contrary-to-fact condition. 
- This type of clause expresses what would have happened in the past if circumstances had been different.
- To express "he would have drunk," you need to use the pluperfect subjunctive.

>    The verb form is: bibisset.

- When you use this "bare" subjunctive, the "if" clause is implied from the context. 
- So, et bibisset would stand on its own and mean "...and he would have drunk (if the water hadn't receded)."
- Imperfect Subjunctive (biberet): Used for a present contrary-to-fact condition. 
  - It means "he would be drinking" (right now, if things were different).
- Pluperfect Subjunctive (bibisset): Used for a past contrary-to-fact condition. 
  - It means "he would have drunk" (at that moment in the past, if things had been different).
