ei qui se agriculturae dedicat intellegendum est se debere arcessere posse materias sibi adiuventes has: scientiam rei, copiam ad sumptui sustinendum, et voluntatem operam dandi. nam denique, ut ait tremelius, is optime aratam terram possidebit qui tenet scientiam, copias, et voluntatem eam colere. scientia atque voluntas non sufficient cuiquam sine copiis a pensis requisitis. voluntas autem vel copiae ad sumptus committendos nihil efficiet sine scientia artis, cum res praestans ullius negotii sit intellegere id quod agendum est, et praecipue in agricultura, ubi voluntas et copiae, sine scientia, saepe ruinam infert possidentibus cum sumptus commissi perditi sunt negotio ex ignorantia facto.

admirato agros magnos, attamen parvum arato. 

hac praecepta, a doctissimo quodam versui impressa, ut opinor, 
hereditas antiquitatis est, ita constat apud carthaginienses, populos
acutissimos, dictum fuisse hoc: subigatur ager viro. 
nam cum ei luctandum sit, si vincitur a terra, obruitur dominus. 
et haud dubie est ager latus perperam cultus minus confert quam parvus
accuratissime aratus.
