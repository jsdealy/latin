hi, dein, publi mi, sunt viri qui ad consultationem tibi vocandi sunt antequam ullum foederem agriculturae iceris, et sine ulla perfectionis exspectatione attingi totae rei dictis eorum, nam commentaria talium scriptorum artificem docent, non efficiunt. exercitatio enim atque consuetudo regnant in fabricis, et semper docentur omnes sua errata. nam cum periculum male gestum perditur, vitanda sunt errata comissa consiliisque doctoris recta via lucetur. itaque praecepta nostra non tendunt perducere scientiam usque ad perfectionem, sed profert manum.
