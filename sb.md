ei qui se agriculturae dedicat intellegendum est se debere arcessere posse materias sibi adiuventes has: scientiam rei, copiam ad sumptui sustinendum, et voluntatem operam dandi. nam denique, ut ait tremelius, is optime aratam terram possidebit qui tenet scientiam, copias, et voluntatem eam colere. scientia atque voluntas non sufficient cuiquam sine copiis a pensis requisitis. voluntas autem vel copiae ad sumptus committendos nihil efficiet sine scientia artis, cum res praestans ullius negotii sit intellegere id quod agendum est, et praecipue in agricultura, ubi voluntas et copiae, sine scientia, saepe ruinam infert possidentibus cum sumptus commissi perditi sunt negotio ex ignorantia facto.

acutissimos, dictum fuisse hoc: subigatur ager viro. 
nam cum ei luctandum sit, si vincitur a terra, obruitur dominus. 
et haud dubie est ager latus perperam cultus minus confert quam parvus

ut incipimus, scientia multarum rerum tendena est, sine qua oratio modo vanitas vel gurges vaniloquentiae ridicula est. modus proprius fingendus est non tantum verbis eligendis, sed eisdem ordinandis. et omnes affectus mentis dati a natura hominibus intime intellegendi sunt, quia vires oratorii completae scientiaeque in affectibus tranquillandis vel incendendis audientium adhibendae sunt.

et dominus dicit samueli: quanto tempore luges saulum, quem regnare super

ad sacrificium advocat.

nequeo discernere. haec eadem veritas nuda est apertaque lux diei, quae praebet personas, histriones, victorias mundi non dimidie tam eleganter belluleque quam lux candelae. veritas fortasse pretium margaritae attinet, quae die optime lucet, sed non adipisci alta adamantis possit, vel gemmae, quae se ostendunt optime luce mutante. mendacio paulo admixto, voluptas semper augetur. Dubitatne aliquis, an si raperentur ex hominibus opiniones vana, spes blandae, estimationes falsae, imaginationes rerum cupitarum, et similia, id quod relinquerentur in mentibus plurum hominum exsanguie et desiccatum esset, completum tristitia et absurditate, sibi odiosum? unus pater severissime poesem "vinum daemonum" nominat quia imaginatio complet, tamen umbra mendacii. sed volans per mente mendacium non nocet, sed haerens et sedens, ut ante dictum est. at quomodocumque hae res in iudiciis affectibusque pravis hominum sunt, tamen veritas, tantum de se iudicans, exquisitionem veritatis, id est eam complectare et procare, scientiam veritatis, id est eam in promptu habere, et assensionem veritatis, id est ea frui, esse summum bonum humanitatis docet.

prima creatura dei in operibus dierum lux sensus fuit---ultima lux rationis fuit. et opus sabbati dehinc lux spiritus eius est. initio, lucem in faciem materiae, vel chai, adspiravit; deinde spiravit lucem faciebus hominum; adhuc spirat et inspirat lucem faciebus electorum. poeta qui gregem illum beatum fecit quod aliter infimum aliis erat, splendide dicit: placet stare in ora adspectans naves undis vexatas; voluptas aspicere per fenestram arcis est, proelium periculumque videns infra evolventia; sed quid possit voluptas aequare stantis in summa veritatis---collis non imperandus, ubi aer semper purus et serenus est---notans errores et nebulas et tempestates, infra in valle---ita semper prospectus ille misericordiae adiunctus est, non inflationi vel superbiae. caelum certe in mundo est si mens hominis movetur caritate, quiescat in providentia, et in axibus veritatis volvitur.

sicut parvuli timent tenebras inire homines mortem timent, et veluti primus timor fabulis augetur, ita secundus. certe, contemplatio mortis, ut merces peccati, et transitio in alio mundo, sacra religiosaque est; sed timor eiusdem, ut testamentum naturae, ignavus est. tamen in meditationibus religiosis nonnumquam confusio vanitatis et superstitionis est. legeris in aliquibus libris sacerdotum de mortificatione, hominem debet consilium sibi capere, quid esset dolor, si tantum cuspis digiti sui comprimeretur vel cruciaretur, et inde imaginare quid dolor mortis est, cum totum corpus corruitur et dissolvitur, nam saepe mortus transitus est minus cum dolore quam ubi artus excruciatur, quoniam vitalia non sunt alacerrima sensu. et ab eo qui modo ut philosophus et homo naturalis dixit, bene dicitur, "Pompa mortis magis terret, quam mors ipsa." gemitús et convulsiones, facies male colorata, amici flentes, et atra et exequiae, et similia, mortum terribilem esse demonstrant. est dignum notatu, nullum affectum in mente hominis tam fessum esse ne timorem per eo superetur, et igitur mors non est tam inimicus terribilis, cum homo tot adiutores in promptu habet qui id expugnare possint. ultio mortem vincit; amor id abicit; honor id studet; maeror ad id volat; timor id preoccupat; immo, ut legimus, postquam otho imperator sua manu interfectus est, misericordia, tenerrimus affectus, multas ad se interficiendas ex mera miseratione regi incitavit, verissima secutores.
