# Formation of Comparative and Superlative Forms

- Ordinarily the comparative and superlative forms of an adjective
  are composed by obtaining the base of the adjective by dropping the
  genitive singular ending and adding the appropriate ending. 

- The comparative form is a consonant stem 3rd declension adjective. 

  - Comparatives are thus the main exception to the rule that 3rd declension
    adjectives are i-stem.

- The superlative form is a 1st/2nd declension adjective.

- Occasionally---and particularly in adjectives with a base ending in 
  a vowel---these forms are created by simply adding *magis* and *maxime* 
  to the sentence. (This isn't really a "form" so much as just the use
  of an adverb.)

- The comparative endings are -ior for masculine and feminine, and -ius
  for neuter. 

  - Comparatives formed via -ior or -ius have a distinctive genitive singular
    ending: -ioris. 

- Superlative endings are -issimus, -issima, and -issimum.

# Examples

carus       carior/ius      carissimus/a/um
longus      longior/ius     longissimus/a/um
fortis      fortior/ius     fortissimus/a/um
felix       felicior/ius    felicissimus/a/um
potens      potentior/ius   potentissimus/a/um
sapiens     sapientior/ius  sapientissimus/a/um

# Meaning

- Aside from the obvious standard meaning, the comparative can also mean
  *rather*, or *to a greater degree than usual or desirable*. 

- The superlative can sometimes mean just *very*. 

- When *quam* follows a comparative, it functions as a coordinating 
  conjunction meaning *than*.  (Hi libri sunt magnior quam illi.)

- When *quam* precedes a superlative it functions as a modifier with
  the resulting combination meaning *having the greatest possible 
  amount of the quality*. (Vir quam iucundissimus erat. (He) was a man
  as pleasant as it is possible to be.)

# Ablative of Comparison

- When the reference to the first thing compared comes in the nominative
  or accusative case, *quam* is often omitted and the second thing compared is
  put in the ablative. (Mens tua clariora est luce.)
