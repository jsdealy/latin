# Ch 24 --- Ablative Absolute; Passive Periphrastic; Dative of Agent

## Ablative Absolute

- The ablative absolute is a type of *participial phrase* --- it thus requires a participle (except
  for when the participle would be a form of esse, which doesn't exist except tacitly). 
  - "absolutum" $\rightarrow$ "separated / loosened from" (the main clause)
- Ablative absolutes are usually set off by commas and describe general circumstances under which 
  the action of the clause takes place.
- Ablative absolute are always "self-contained" and as a general rule the person or thing occuring therein
  does not occur as subject or direct object outside the phrase in the main clause. 
  - Roma visa, viri gaudebant $\rightarrow$ ablative absolute (note noun is ablative)
    - visa modifies Roma, not viri
  - Romam videntes, viri gaudebant $\rightarrow$ not an ablative absolute (note noun is accusative)
    - videntes modifies viri, not Romam
  - "Caesar having taken the enemy massacred them" is *Caesar hostes captos trucidavit* not 
    *hostibus captis Caesar eos trucidavit*. 
  - "As I was reading this I saw you" is *haec legens te vidi* not *me haec legente te vidi*.
- Participles in ablative absolutes can still take direct objects (and/or any of the other
  verbal modifiers participles are subject to).
  - Eo imperium tenente, eventum timeo! $\rightarrow$ (with) him holding power, I fear the outcome! 
- A pair of nouns (one functioning predicatively) or a single noun and a predicate adjective, when
  set in ablative case, can function as ablative absolute. 
  - There is no participle for esse, but that is the meaning to be understood. 
  - Caesare duce, nil timebamus $\rightarrow$ two nouns forming the ablative absolute with 
    participial esse tacitly understood.

### Bradley's Arnold on Ablative Absolutes

- Long and complex ablative absolutes are better replaced with cum-clauses.
- The future participle is rarely used in ablative absolutes. 
- The past participle of a deponent verb is active in meaning, and affords an alternative to ablative absolutes.
  - *Haec locutus rediit* is just as good as *his dictis rediit*.
    - Here "locutus" is an adjective modifying the understood (masculine) subject of rediit.

### Elegant Trick: Using Deponents in Ablative Absolute 

- Because deponent participles are active in meaning, they *can* be used in an ablative absolute.
- **`revertor, reverti, reversus sum`** is a deponent verb for "to return." 
* **Example:** **`Duce ab arce centri urbis reverso...`**
* **Analysis:** This means "With the leader having returned..." `Reverso` is the ablative participle of `revertor`, and this is a correct and sophisticated way to form the phrase.

## Passive Periphrastic & Dative of Agent

- A passive verb form consisting of the gerundive (future passive participle) + sum. 
- Typically conveys obligation ("to be done-ness").
- Gerundive agrees with the subject of sum in number, case, and gender. 
- Instead of ablative, the passive periphrastic uses the dative of agency.
  - Hic liber mihi legendus erit. $\rightarrow$ This book will have to be read by me with care.
  - Pax ducibus nostris petenda erat. $\rightarrow$ Peace had to be sought by our leaders.
