Terminus, ut suspicor, erit similis inspiciendi tam longam quam possum, quo fluctus carpuntur vento, et omnes fiunt unum---mare, aspergo, aer. Fortasse aliquis mihi accedet, et in limine lucis caerulei obscurus manebit donec ultimum momentum. Opinor post meridie futurum esse sero, caelum lucens illo ostreae albo, in quo vanescunt omnes. Consistam aspiciens caelum, et eo momento noscam me solum esse, et perperam me figuram cognovisse mihi venientem, quod, tempore diei aspecto, recte sit, scilicet vento inspirato et sole albo fere cado sub tenuo cano fere immoto ponto. Perfecta hora, ut videtur, iterum, ad vivendum.
