Memoria a senectute deteritur. Haud dubie ita est iis qui memoriam suam exercendam neglegunt, et qui pingues a natura sua. At Themistocles sciit nomine omnes Athenienses --- opinarisne eum, annis provectus, obviam cum convenisset Aristidi istum Lysimachum appelavisse? Non tantum nosco viros hodie viventes, at fulgentem memoriam patrum avorumque retineo. Nec timeo legere inscriptiones sepulcrales, a quibus memoria deleri famast. Immo mortui imago in mente mea recollecta ideo validissima fit.

Epistulae tuae mihi adveniunt nimis raro, quamquam iter ad Romam facientes multum apud te crebriores sunt quam ii ad Athenas apud me, et magis credis me in Roma futurum quam te in Athenis. Dubium hoc est causa brevitatis huius epistulae, ita nolui sermonem intimum nostrum in nescio cuius manibus, cum incertus fuissem ubi te futurum. Exspecto signa Megarica aestuose quos mihi descripsisti. Ullum eiusdem generis quod academiae scitum censes ne moreris mihi mittere; pecuniae meae confidas. Hoc est genus rei quod cupiebam. Quaero res aptissimas gymnasio. Lentulus naves pollicetur. Curate obserate hoc. Vale.

I condemn all violence in the education of a tender soul that is being trained for honour and freedom. There is something servile in harshness and constraint; and I believe that what cannot be accomplished by reason, and by wisdom and tact, can never be accomplished by force. That is how I was brought up. They tell me that in all my childhood I was only whipped twice, and then very mildly. I owed the same upbringing to my own children. They all died at nurse, except Leonor, my one daughter who escaped this unhappy fate. She ahs reached the age of more than 6 without anything but words, and very gentle words, being used to guide her and correct her childish faults. Her mother's indulgence readily concurred in this. And even if my hopes in her should be disappointed, there will be enough other causes for this without blaming my educational system, which I know to be both just and natural. I should have followed it still more scrupulously with sons, who are born less subservient and are freer by nature. I should have loved to build up their courage by honest and frank treatment. I have never seen any other effects of a whipping than to make the soul more cowardly and more perversely obstinate.
