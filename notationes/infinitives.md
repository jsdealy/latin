# Infinitives

## Basics

- Each verb has *six* infinitives
  - Three active (present, perfect, future)
  - Three passive (present, perfect, future)

- Example: Laudare
  - laudare 
  - laudavisse
  - laudaturus, a, um esse
  - laudari 
  - laudatus, a, um esse
  - laudatum iri

- Note that future active and perfect passive use verbal adjectives (=participles)!
- Past active infinitive is built from the past stem + isse.
- The perfect and future infinitives are rarely to be translated / understood literally.

- There is also a passive periphrastic infinitive:
  - laudandus, a, um esse

## Usage Summary

- Neuter verbal noun (*errare est humanum*).
- Verb complement (*debeo ire*).
- Direct object clause anchor (*iussit eos venire*).
- Indirect statement / speech report.

## Infinitives in Indirect Statements

- Latin allows for both direct speech reports and indirect speech reports.
  - Direct (with the special verb "inquit"): *Iulia, magister inquit, discipula est bona*.
    - "Julia," says the teacher, "is a good student."
  - Indirect: *Magister dicit Iuliam esse bonam discipulam*.
    - The teacher says that Julia is a good student.

- Latin indirect statement contrasts with English in two major ways:
  1. Latin doesn't use subordinate clauses, but rather infinitive phrases with accusative subject.
  2. Latin doesn't use a complementizer word like "that" in English.

- This indirect statement construction is known as *Accusative Cum Infinitivo* (ACI). 

- ACI is used in Latin with verbs of speech, mental activity, and sense perception.
  - Notably, English uses infinitive constructions for some of these kinds of cases,
    e.g., "Bob considers Tom to be a great guy".

- In Latin, the accusative subject is (almost) always expressed, even in reflexive cases.
  - E.g., *Iulia putat se esse bonam discipulam*.

## Tenses in Indirect Speech

- The tense of the embedded ACI clause is relative to the verb under which it is embedded.
- Present infinitives do not necessarily denote the actual present, but rather
  the same time as the main verb. (E.g., *dixerunt se esse innocentes* --- they said they
  were [then, at the time of their saying so] innocent). 
- The perfect and future infintives function analogously, denoting past and future
  times not absolutely, but relative to the main verb.
