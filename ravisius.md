Nor, indeed, among the deeds commonly accomplished by women do I think there is any deserving of less praise and admiration than the struggle in which, under the leadership and command of Telesilla, the women of Argos fought against Cleomenes, king of the Argives. It is recorded that this woman was skilled in the art of poetry. Born of very noble parents, she fell ill, and, when suffering from ill health, received an oracle’s answer that she must devote herself zealously to the service of Mars if she wished to regain her lost strength. Obeying the divine command, she turned all her effort and attention to musical songs and harmonies, and in a short time recovered her health. And because of her skill in the poetic art she gained among other women the highest fame and praise.

Later, when Cleomenes, king of the Spartans, had killed many citizens of Argos—some say seven hundred and seventy in all—and was aiming to seize and occupy the city, the women in the prime of life resolved to defend their city against the enemy. So, under Telesilla’s leadership, they quickly took up arms and suddenly gathered in a body to man the city walls. This greatly astonished the enemy. Cleomenes, after repeatedly attempting in vain to storm the city and losing many soldiers, was finally forced to retreat. The other king, Demaratus (as Socrates says), after seizing part of the city called Paphnia, was driven out.

Thus, by the counsel and courage of the women, the city was freed; and the women who had fallen in the fighting were buried in the street called Argia. To those who had survived the battle it was granted to set up, if they wished, a statue of Mars as a memorial of their valor. Some say this battle took place on the sixteenth day of the month, others on the Kalends of the month now reckoned fourth among the Argives, which was formerly called Pyrrhios, in which, even down to our own day, certain sacred rites are celebrated among the Argives. In these, the women wear cloaks and dress in men’s clothing, carrying men’s weapons, while the veils are taken from their heads; and they engage in lively contests. Moreover, those who had fought together were not, as Herodotus says, long in arranging marriage matches, but quickly—each man taking as wife the woman who seemed to excel the others in merit—joined themselves in matrimony.

Neque vero inter ea, quae communiter a mulieribus gesta sunt, minore laude atque admiratione, dignam contentionem visum iri censeo, qua contra Cleomenem Argiuorum regem, Telesillidis ductu auspiciisque, mulieres Argivae certarunt. Ea vero mulierem, poeticae disciplinae fuisse peritam, memoriae proditum est. Nam parentibus nobilissimis orta, cum valitudine adversa laboraret, ab oraculo responsum accepit, studiose Martis a se colendas esse, si amissam valitudinem recipere vellet. Quapropter ipsa deorum praeceptis obtemperans, omne studium operamque ad musicos cantus atque harmonias convertens, brevi tempore amissam valitudinem recepit. Atque ob artis poeticae disciplinam, plurimum apud ceteras mulieres, famae ac laudis est consecuta. Postmodum vero, cum Cleomenes Spartiatum rex, multis Argivorum civium interfectis, quippe quos septingentos & septuagina supra septem milia fuisse, quidam affirmant, Argos ad occupandam civitatem contenderet, tum mulieres in aetatis flore constitutas, animi bus hiscuit civitatis adversus hostes tuendae. Itaque duce Telesillide, celeriter armis assumptis, subita corona civitatis moenia coeperunt. Quae res non parum admirationis hostibus praebuit. Et Cleomenem expugnatione saepius nequicquam tentata, pluribusque militibus amissis, ad extremum retrocedere coegerunt. Alterum vero regem Demaratum, ut Socrates (inquit) cum iam parte civitatis, quae Paphnia dicitur, occupasset, eiecerunt. Ita mulierum consilio atque virtute, liberata civitate, mulieres omnes quae in pugna cecidissent, in via quae Argia dicitur, sepeliri decreverunt. His autem quae pugnae superfuerant, permisimus, ut, vel Marti simulacrum, earum virtutis monumentu, statuerent. Hanc vero pugnam, nonnulli sexto decimo die, alii autem Calendis, gesta fuisse tradunt, eius mensis qui nunc quartus apud Argivos habetur, quondam vero Pyrrhios numerabatur, quo nostram ad aetatem sacra quadam apud Argivos celebrantur, in quibus mulieres chlamydes, ac virilem veste indutae, viril autem pen sum gestantes, & mulieribus velamentis capito submotis, versantur. Ut autem inter pugnantes sibi consocium instaurant, non serius, ut Herodotus inquit, sed celerius, qui circa urbem habitabant, ut quisque alias excellere videbatur, in cuius ceteis, sese in matrimonium sociabant.
