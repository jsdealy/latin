# Notationes: Assorted Notes

## participles

- the present active participle takes -i in ablative when used as an 
  adjective, but -e when used substantively or when it takes a direct object. 
  - a patre amanti
  - cum patre filium amante
  - ab amante amatur

### passive periphrastic

- with intransitives it's impersonal and neuter. 
- with transitives the subject's gender and case must be matched.
- it doesn't make sense to combine it with debere; e.g., *id purgandum esse debet* is a bit
  like saying "it ought to be to be cleaned".

## gender quirks

- res rei (f)
- gens gentis (f)
- we use multi/multos to refer to many people, multa/multa to refer to many things

## indirect discourse

- the main clause in indirect discourse takes the infinitive 
  with the subject accusative ("ACI").
- *all subordinate clauses regularly take the subjunctive*
  - e.g., *dicit esse nonnullos quorum auctoritas plurimum valeat*
  - this includes *conditional antecedents*
    - e.g., *nisi iurasset, se scelus facturum esse arbitrabatur*
- the exceptions regarding the subjunctive in subordinate clauses seems to
  seem to be cases where the independent truth of what is contained in that
  clause is being emphasized. 
  - *quis neget haec omnia **quae videmus** deorum potestate administrari*


## subjunctive quirks
- Bare subjunctives can function as the main clause (apodosis) of a past contrary-to-fact condition. 
- This type of clause expresses what would have happened in the past if circumstances had been different.
- To express "he would have drunk," you need to use the pluperfect subjunctive.

>    The verb form is: bibisset.

- When you use this "bare" subjunctive, the "if" clause is implied from the context. 
- So, et bibisset would stand on its own and mean "...and he would have drunk (if the water hadn't receded)."
- Imperfect Subjunctive (biberet): Used for a present contrary-to-fact condition. 
  - It means "he would be drinking" (right now, if things were different).
- Pluperfect Subjunctive (bibisset): Used for a past contrary-to-fact condition. 
  - It means "he would have drunk" (at that moment in the past, if things had been different).

## bare ablative of place from

- you can use a bare ablative to signify place from which if the place is *a town* or *a small island*
  or your home (domus)
  - *abiit Romā*, *domō profectus est*, etc.
- poets are more liberal and sometimes disregard the restriction (*Italiā discessit*)

## impero et iubeo

- these verbs take a dative of person commanded and an ut+subjunctive clause, rather than ACI.

## faveo

- this take the dative of the person favored, not the accusative $\rightarrow$ *isti non faveo*
