Memoria a senectute deteritur. Haud dubie ita est iis qui memoriam suam exercendam neglegunt, et qui pingues a natura sua. At Themistocles sciit nomine omnes Athenienses --- opinarisne eum, annis provectus, obviam cum convenisset Aristidi istum Lysimachum appelavisse? Non tantum nosco viros hodie viventes, at fulgentem memoriam patrum avorumque retineo. Nec timeo legere inscriptiones sepulcrales, a quibus memoria deleri famast. Immo mortui imago in mente mea recollecta ideo validissima fit.

Epistulae tuae mihi adveniunt nimis raro, quamquam iter ad Romam facientes multum apud te crebriores sunt quam ii ad Athenas apud me, et magis credis me in Roma futurum quam te in Athenis. Dubium hoc est causa brevitatis huius epistulae, ita nolui sermonem intimum nostrum in nescio cuius manibus, cum incertus fuissem ubi te futurum. Exspecto signa Megarica aestuose quos mihi descripsisti. Ullum eiusdem generis quod academiae scitum censes ne moreris mihi mittere; pecuniae meae confidas. Hoc est genus rei quod cupiebam. Quaero res aptissimas gymnasio. Lentulus naves pollicetur. Curate obserate hoc. Vale.

Valde obligo tibi ob librum Serapionis mi missum, a quo, inter nos, vix unam ex mille sententiam intellego. Ne id sub titulum 'donae' ponendum tibi esset, iubebam tibi solvi nummis. At mentione nummorum facta, rem cum Titinio recte resolvito ullo pacto quo potes, quaeso. Si non tenet fidem suam, optime faceres si malam remitteres venditionem, ut opinor, dummodo Pompeia ut assentiatur adduci possit. Et si deficit etiam illud, satius est nummos solvere quam incommoditatem pati. Gratissimum esset si ante abires hoc resolveres solito cum more tuo negotiali.

Alii, contra, consueti excogitare a principiis, non intellegunt
res sentiendi, assequentes principia, nequentes per acie percipere.
