# participles

- the present active participle takes -i in ablative when used as an 
  adjective, but -e when used substantively or when it takes a direct object. 
  - a patre amanti
  - cum patre filium amante
  - ab amante amatur

## passive periphrastic

- with intransitives it's impersonal and neuter. 
- with transitives the subject's gender and case must be matched.

# gender quirks

- res rei (f)
- gens gentis (f)
- we use multi/multos to refer to many people, multa/multa to refer to many things

# subjunctive quirks
- Bare subjunctives can function as the main clause (apodosis) of a past contrary-to-fact condition. 
- This type of clause expresses what would have happened in the past if circumstances had been different.
- To express "he would have drunk," you need to use the pluperfect subjunctive.

>    The verb form is: bibisset.

- When you use this "bare" subjunctive, the "if" clause is implied from the context. 
- So, et bibisset would stand on its own and mean "...and he would have drunk (if the water hadn't receded)."
- Imperfect Subjunctive (biberet): Used for a present contrary-to-fact condition. 
  - It means "he would be drinking" (right now, if things were different).
- Pluperfect Subjunctive (bibisset): Used for a past contrary-to-fact condition. 
  - It means "he would have drunk" (at that moment in the past, if things had been different).



# similis with genitive versus with dative

## The Rule: `Similis` with Dative or Genitive

The adjective `similis` ("like, similar") can be followed by a noun in either the dative or the genitive case. While they are often used interchangeably, there is a distinct tendency in classical prose:

1.  **The Genitive Case** is typically preferred when `similis` refers to **living beings**, especially personal pronouns (`mei`, `tui`, `sui`, `nostri`, `vestri`) and other persons. It often implies an essential or internal likeness (in character, nature, etc.).

2.  **The Dative Case** is used more broadly for both **persons and things**. It can denote a more external or general similarity and is the more common construction overall, especially for inanimate objects.

## Sources and Examples

This distinction is explained in standard reference grammars. For instance, **Allen and Greenough's New Latin Grammar, ยง359.b** notes:

> "Adjectives signifying likeness, fitness, friendliness, and their opposites, take the Dative... *Similis* (like) sometimes takes the Genitive, but this is an early use, and is common in Cicero only in the phrase *veri similis* (probable), and of persons, especially the personal pronouns..."

**Examples from Classical Authors:**

* **With Genitive (Persons):**
    * `Filius est **similis patris**.` (The son is like his father.)
    * `Nemo est **similis tui**.` (No one is like you.)

* **With Dative (Things):**
    * `Mors est **somno similis**.` (Death is like sleep.)
    * `Haec vox est **illi voci similis**.` (This voice is similar to that voice.)
