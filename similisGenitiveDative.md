# Similis: Genitive Versus Dative

## The Rule: `Similis` with Dative or Genitive

The adjective `similis` ("like, similar") can be followed by a noun in either the dative or the genitive case. While they are often used interchangeably, there is a distinct tendency in classical prose:

1.  **The Genitive Case** is typically preferred when `similis` refers to **living beings**, especially personal pronouns (`mei`, `tui`, `sui`, `nostri`, `vestri`) and other persons. It often implies an essential or internal likeness (in character, nature, etc.).

2.  **The Dative Case** is used more broadly for both **persons and things**. It can denote a more external or general similarity and is the more common construction overall, especially for inanimate objects.

## Sources and Examples

This distinction is explained in standard reference grammars. For instance, **Allen and Greenough's New Latin Grammar, ยง359.b** notes:

> "Adjectives signifying likeness, fitness, friendliness, and their opposites, take the Dative... *Similis* (like) sometimes takes the Genitive, but this is an early use, and is common in Cicero only in the phrase *veri similis* (probable), and of persons, especially the personal pronouns..."

**Examples from Classical Authors:**

* **With Genitive (Persons):**
    * `Filius est similis patris.` (The son is like his father.)
    * `Nemo est similis tui.` (No one is like you.)

* **With Dative (Things):**
    * `Mors est somno similis.` (Death is like sleep.)
    * `Haec vox est illi voci similis.` (This voice is similar to that voice.)
